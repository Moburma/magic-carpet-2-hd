    Gamepads and joysticks

  the 'gamepad' group inside the config.ini file can be used to define how gamepad elements are picked up by the game. three different joysticks (each with two axes), two hats and six buttons can be defined using the keywords shown below.
  based on user preference, the camera angle axes (defined by the yaw and pitch) can share the same joystick as the menu navigation (nav_ns and nav_ew), because based on the current scene rendered the game provides enough context for the gamepad controller logic to switch between flight and menu navigation modes. also of note is that a solitary axis can control movement in one direction (see below for 2 examples).
  hats can be used to either control longitudinal/transversal movement or menu navigation.
  the integer value expected is either '1'+ for enabled items or '0' for disabled ones. an easy way of visualizing gamepad input is to run jstest, a binary that comes with the joystick package, and adding 1 to the item identifier.
 

possible keywords:
[gamepad]
axis_yaw = 0 ; roll and yaw axis (initiates turns during flight)
axis_yaw_inv = false ; false - no inversion needed, true - axis values need inversion
axis_pitch = 0 ; pitch (moves camera up/down during flight)
axis_pitch_inv = false
axis_long = 0 ; longitudinal movement (aka forward / back)
axis_long_inv = false
axis_trans = 0 ; transversal movement (aka strafe left/right)
axis_trans_inv = false
axis_nav_ns = 0 ; menu navigation North / South
axis_nav_ns_inv = false
axis_nav_ew = 0 ; menu navigation East / West
axis_nav_ew_inv = false
hat_nav = 0 ; menu navigation North / South / East / West
hat_nav_inv = false ; invert vertical axis
hat_mov = 0 ; longitudinal and transversal movement
hat_mov_inv = false ; invert vertical axis
button_spell = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for displaying the spellbook
button_minimap = 0 ; half-screen minimap
button_fire_R = 0 ; fire right-hand spell, also right mouse button equivalent
button_fire_L = 0 ; fire left-hand spell, also left mouse button equivalent
button_fwd = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for forward movement
button_back = 0 ; joystick button-press code used for backward movement
axis_dead_zone = 2048 ; increase if _mouse_ is unresponsive



    Sample setups

XBOX controllers:

[gamepad]
axis_yaw = 4 ; roll and yaw - horizontal axis on the right joystick
axis_pitch = 5 ; pitch - vertical axis on the right joystick
axis_long = 2 ; longitudinal movement - vertical axis on the left joystick
axis_long_inv = true ; needs inversion
axis_trans = 1 ; transversal movement - horizontal axis on the left joystick
hat_nav = 1 ; menu navigation on the hat
hat_nav_inv = true ; needs inversion on the vertical axis
button_minimap = 1 ; half-screen minimap
button_spell = 3 ; spellbook - (X) button
button_fire_R = 5 ; fire right-hand spell - right button
button_fire_L = 6 ; fire left-hand spell - left button
axis_dead_zone = 3000 ; joysticks are quite noisy and can get bumped accidentally so definitely at least 3000



Logitech Attack 3 (the joystick shares flight and navigation modes, the 3-rd axis can be used for fwd-back movement)

[gamepad]
axis_yaw = 1 ; roll and yaw axis (initiates turns during flight)
axis_yaw_inv = false ; false - no inversion needed, true - axis values need inversion
axis_pitch = 2 ; pitch (moves camera up/down during flight)
axis_pitch_inv = false
;optional axis_long = 3 ; longitudinal movement (aka forward / back)
axis_long_inv = true
axis_nav_ns = 1 ; menu navigation North / South
axis_nav_ew = 2 ; menu navigation East / West
button_spell = 8 ; joystick button-press code used for displaying the spellbook
button_fire_R = 1 ; fire right-hand spell, also right mouse button equivalent
button_fire_L = 2 ; fire left-hand spell, also left mouse button equivalent
button_fwd = 6 ; joystick button-press code used for forward movement
button_back = 7 ; joystick button-press code used for backward movement
button_minimap = 9 ; half-screen minimap
axis_dead_zone = 2048 ; increase if _mouse_ is unresponsive
